Types of Data Binding
In Angular, there are four types of data binding: one-way, two-way, event, and template binding. Let's take a look at each one.

One-Way Data Binding
One-way data binding is the most basic type of data binding. It allows you to bind a variable in one part of the application to another variable in another part of the application. This type of binding is used when you want to ensure that changes made in one part of the application wonâ€™t affect the other part.

Two-Way Data Binding
Two-way data binding is a more advanced type of data binding. It allows developers to bind a variable in one part of an application to a variable in another part of the application and vice versa. This type of binding is used when you want to ensure that changes made in one part of the application will be reflected in the other part automatically.

For example, let's say you have a text box that displays a user's name. You can use two-way data binding to bind the value of the text box to a user object in another part of your application. That way, when the user changes their name in the text box, the same change will be made to the user object automatically.

Event Data Binding
Event data binding is used to bind events such as clicks and mouseovers to functions or variables. This type of binding is useful when you want to trigger an action when an event occurs.

For example, let's say you want to display a message when the user clicks on a button. You can use event data binding to bind the click event of the button to a function that displays the message.

Template Data Binding
Template data binding is used to bind template variables or expressions to functions or variables. This type of binding is useful when you want to display dynamic information in your templates.

For example, let's say you have a list of users that you want to display on your website. You can use template data binding to bind each user object in your list to a template variable that displays their information dynamically on your website.
